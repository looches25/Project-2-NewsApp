          <h2>#1: News is not meant to be social </h2>
          <p>
            People rely on the news for information to make decisions. Our ability
            to receive and consume news must go beyond what other people share on
            Twitter and on their Facebook pages, because disseminating news on
            social media platforms ultimately becomes a popularity game for clicks
            and views. This phenomenon, as we have seen, develops echo chambers.
            If you need news to serve a social function, you are really just
            looking for gossip.

          <h2>#2: Expect that everyone has a bias </h2>
          <p>
            Countries and corporations alike have interests that they want to
            influence. And as much as one strives to be neutral and objective in
            disseminating news and information, the overall framing of a message
            is inevitably altered through the choice of auxiliary information,
            context-setting and words. Language is symbolic and not absolutely
            precise, so it is expected that anyone can find fault with how any
            person, any article, or any statement is tinged with bias. That is
            expected.

          <h2>#3: The future is marked by plurality</h2>
          <p>
            {" "}
            Digitalisation has accelerated globalisation. However, this is not a
            singular cultural experience for society. On an individual level, this
            is a combination of many experiences that a person may encounter, from
            watching traditional TV, to algorithmically-personalised social media
            feeds, to consuming foreign products and services. The cultural locale
            is varied and shifting, and not always easily articulated, demarcated
            or utilised by governments and corporations.

          <h2>#4: Engineered pluralism is needed to counter silos </h2>
          We are in a situation where polarisation is expected and somehow
          systemic. To break out of our echo chambers, we need to regain basic
          access to <i>other</i> echo chambers - digitally. The idea of pluralism
          here is not scholarly; pluralism is relative in that instead of being in
          one echo chamber, a user may be exposed to multiple and varied echo
          chambers - those that are agreeble, those that are disagreeble, even
          those that one may not care about or never thought existed.
